`ddplot` is a package that allows you to create D3 based SVG graphics using a simple R API. For now the package is experimental and has a limited number of graphics (more will be added in the future), therefore, it is not meant to be used in production. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `ddplot` from Github with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("feddelegrand7/ddplot")
```

## Usage
